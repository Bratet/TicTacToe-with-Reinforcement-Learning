# Tic Tac Toe with Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains an implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game interface from scratch, along with an AI opponent that utilizes three different reinforcement learning algorithms:

1. Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
2. Monte Carlo Off Policy Control
3. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning

## Installation

Before you can run the program, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then you have to install required libraries :
```bash
pip install numpy tkinter tqdm
```

Next, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bratet/TicTacToe-with-Reinforcement-Learning.git
```

Navigate to the repository's directory:
```bash
cd TicTacToe-with-Reinforcement-Learning
```


## Usage

To play the game, run the `main.py` file:
```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to choose one of the three algorithms:
```bash
Choose an algorithm:

1. MDP
2. Monte Carlo
3. Temporal Difference
```


Enter the number corresponding to your chosen algorithm and hit Enter. The game will then start, and you will be playing against the AI that uses the selected reinforcement learning algorithm.
